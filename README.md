History:
Trained prod model, took 3 hours, is documented, stats looked very promising

spent a ton of time working to setup autoregressive prediction and evaluation.  

RMSE has been >7000m for wave height, now down to 2.x rmse, still an order of magnitude off validation report of .2x.

Working of ensuring evaluation doesn't have issues

Next steps will likely be train a larger model, and potentially modify model architecture

In modifying model architecture, I risk breaking everything, so will need to be an addition
